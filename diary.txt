My Programming Diary

Hi, my name is Joao Witor Felipe;
Today I'm starting with my diary in English (I'm praticing in this diary);

Ok, let's go!

----------19-ago-2020----------
I studied programming functional concepts;

Today I learned a little about point-free notation and function composition;
Reinforced some knowledge, for example: immutability, functions pure and a little bit referential transparency;

There was no pratice, just concepts, I'm following this tutorial about programming functional: https://medium.com/@cscalfani/so-you-want-to-be-a-functional-programmer-part-1-1f15e387e536

----------20-ago-2020----------

Okay, today I learned many things;
Let's go one at a time:
    -> Curried Function
	A Curried Function is a function that only takes a single parameter at a time; 
     	This works together with the composition functions;
	Curried function helps a lot because of refactoring;
	When we create great functions, stay easy to refactor later
	because we can reduce to small functions with just one parameter;

    -> Common Functional Functions
	In functional programming there are no loop builders;
	Then came the common functions that are the map, filter and reduce;
 
    -> Referential Transparency
	Jesus, this is very cool, I can represent my function with another
	expression where the value is equivalent, it is very satisfactory;
	It really makes me more comfortable!!!

    -> Execution Order
	Okay, this is still a little confusing, because of multi/single thread, but the important is 
	thing is that the function is pure and independent;
	
    -> Type Annotations 
	In this topic, I learned about data types, but it was easier to understand; 

And all of that is what I learned today, it was a lot of thing;
And tommorrow, I will venture to Clojure to pratice everything that has been learned; 
So, see you tommorrow!!!

Hello guys, how are you?

Well, today is a great day, I programmed in Clojure :D;
This is weird, but the more I read and pratice, the more sense it makes;
I did simple things like: addition, division and multiplication;
And also, I learned functions like "doc (parameter)" which shows me the documentation for some other function;
And that whas my day, really Clojure is weird, but really cool at the same time;


----------23-ago-2020----------

Good morning, afternoon, night :D 

Really, Clojure is cool! Today I learned to declare functions;
Below is a general list of what I learned about functions in Clojure:
	- Pass parameter, it was easy;
	- Arity, this is really cool!Passing a number of different parameter and doing different things is really cool!;
	- Ready-made functions, wich are constantly (return a function that receive N parameters and return only one) and identity (wich return only the first parameter of the function)

Finally, I'm very happy because I managed to solve some Clojure exercises; 
I was wrong in some syntax, but it was really cool; 

----------24-ago-2020----------

I'm very angry!
Bro, I was solving a Clojure exercise that is about "applying function" and I was able to solve it, but I couldn't understand some thing, well I questioned my brother-in-law and I hope for an answer;

And that was it for today, good night!

----------25-ago-2020----------

Okay, today I'm very happy :D 
Because I managed to understand a little better about "applying function" in Clojure;

And the best part is that I managed to solve an exercise that my brother-in-law gave me to fix the "applying function"!

Yes, currently my brother-in-law/godfather (Rahony Goulart Ricardo) is my source of inspiration to always want to improve, so I ask for a lot of help and suggestions about everything for him :D 

----------26-ago-2020----------

Today I solved some exercise of Clojure and I feels that I can read the Clojure syntax a little better;
Not much, but it becomes more evident to me!
And more and more I feel satisfied with what I'm learning, functional programming is really interesting;
My idea is to finish the Clojure exercises to build some application for put into pratice what I learned;
I think that's it, good night;

----------27-ago-2020----------

Well, I'm very happy today, because I finished the Clojure documentation part about functions and my gamer chair arrived :D; 

I'm thinking about tomorrow, what I'm going to learn, it will probably be about "sequential collection", yes in Clojure;

And I'm feeling that my English has improved a little bit, a little bit;

Okay, that's it, I'll see you tomorrow in that same repository :P, good night!
