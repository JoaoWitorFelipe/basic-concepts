My Programming Diary

Hi, my name is Joao Witor Felipe;
Today I'm starting with my diary in English (I'm praticing in this diary);

Ok, let's go!

19-ago-2020
I studied programming functional concepts;

Today I learned a little about point-free annotation and function composition;
Reinforced some knowledge, for example: immutability, functions pure and a little bit referential transparency;

There was no pratice, just concepts, I'm following this tutorial about programming functional: https://medium.com/@cscalfani/so-you-want-to-be-a-functional-programmer-part-1-1f15e387e536
