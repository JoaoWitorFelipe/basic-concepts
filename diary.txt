My Programming Diary

Hi, my name is Joao Witor Felipe;
Today I'm starting with my diary in English (I'm praticing in this diary);

Ok, let's go!

----------19-ago-2020----------
I studied programming functional concepts;

Today I learned a little about point-free annotation and function composition;
Reinforced some knowledge, for example: immutability, functions pure and a little bit referential transparency;

There was no pratice, just concepts, I'm following this tutorial about programming functional: https://medium.com/@cscalfani/so-you-want-to-be-a-functional-programmer-part-1-1f15e387e536

Okay, today I learned many things;
Let's go one at a time:
    -> Curried Function
	A Curried Function is a function that only takes a single parameter at a time; 
     	This works together with the composition functions;
	Curried function helps a lot because of refactoring;
	When we create great functions, stay easy to refactor later
	because we can reduce to small functions with just one parameter;

    -> Common Functional Functions
	In functional programming there are no loop builders;
	Then came the common functions that are the map, filter and reduce;
 
    -> Referential Transparency
	Jesus, this is very cool, I can represent my function with another
	expression where the value is equivalent, it is very satisfactory;
	It really makes me more comfortable!!!

    -> Execution Order
	Okay, this is still a little confusing, because of multi/single thread, but the important is 
	thing is that the function is pure and independent;
	
    -> Type Annotations 
	In this topic, I learned about data types, but it was easier to understand; 

And all of that is what I learned today, it was a lot of thing;
And tommorrow, I will venture to Clojure to pratice everything that has been learned; 
So, see you tommorrow!!!

Hello guys, how are you?

Well, today is a great day, I programmed in Clojure :D;
This is weird, but the more I read and pratice, the more sense it makes;
I did simple things like: addition, division and multiplication;
And also, I learned functions like "doc (parameter)" which shows me the documentation for some other function;
And that whas my day, really Clojure is weird, but really cool at the same time;
